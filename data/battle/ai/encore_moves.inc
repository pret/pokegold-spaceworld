; AI_SMART encourages these moves with Encore.

; BUG: Includes mostly status moves, but has a few attacking moves that seem
; to have been included in lieu of another status move by mistake.
; Also, the list cuts off rather early, not including most of the new status moves.
; None of these issues were fixed for the final game.
